Ecology and evolution is becoming an increasingly quantitative discipline. Even if they never become scientists, I think **it is important for all students to understand basic quantitative principles** so they can critically evaluate the science they are presented with in their daily lives. I teach using programming in R because it allows students to practice analyses and see their data come to life in beautiful graphs, maps, and other visual representations. The online R community also provides a peer-support network for first-time users and expert users alike.

I think **experiential learning is essential for students in ecology and evolution**. No experience sparks an understanding of nature better than sensing the ecological world. I have shared experiential training with many mentees in the field. The accessibility of my field site in southeast Manitoba provides opportunities for all people of all abilities to experience fieldwork - learners can try radiotelemetry from the road and watch elk on the crop fields. For students whose projects include lab work, I think participating in the process is also an essential part of the process.
