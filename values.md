###Equity, diversity, and inclusion
I am fortunate to work with a diverse group of collaborators, and I think our collective perspectives bring a richness to the work we do together. I extend support to equity-seeking groups across academia by participating in initiatives like the Long-term Research Section of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution and Support Our Science that help share data and funding with students and early-career researchers from equity-seeking groups. I recruit mentees equitably and maintain an remain flexible to any accommodations my mentees might need to succeed (e.g., irregular work hours for childcare, parttime programs for professionals, etc.). I foster a welcoming and safer environment by representing my own identity as a transgender person and seeking ways to highlight other identities in academia.
